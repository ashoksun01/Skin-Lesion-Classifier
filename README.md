# LesionLens - Skin Lesion Classification Using Deep Learning

## Project Summary
LesionLens is a machine learning-powered web application that provides near-instant visual diagnostic support for skin lesions, classifying them as malignant or benign. The project addresses the global issue of melanoma and other skin cancers, which are often misdiagnosed due to visual similarities between benign and malignant lesions. By offering a low-cost, accessible diagnostic support tool, LesionLens aims to reduce unnecessary biopsies, improve early detection, and make dermatological care more accessible.

- **Problem:** Melanoma and other malignant skin lesions are challenging to differentiate visually, even for trained clinicians, leading to high biopsy rates and delayed care. 
- **Solution:** LesionLens provides real-time diagnostic support using a machine learning model that classifies user-uploaded images of skin lesions. It offers guidance on potential malignancy risk while emphasizing the need for professional consultation.
- **Target Users:** High-risk individuals with frequent lesions, people avoiding care due to cost or inconvenience, and anyone seeking quick, reliable information about their skin lesions.

## How It Works
1. **Image Upload:** Users upload an image of their skin lesion through the web application.
2. **Preprocessing:** The image is processed (resizing, noise removal, RGB normalization) to ensure consistent quality.
3. **Classification:** The processed image is fed into the trained model ensemble (MobileNet, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, NASNetMobile), which classifies the lesion as malignant or benign.
4. **Results Display:** The model provides a diagnostic support result with a probability score, along with guidance to consult a dermatologist.

## Model Performance
LesionLens outperformed human expert classification in diagnosing malignant skin lesions, achieving the following metrics:

| Model                     | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | AUC  |
|---------------------------|-----------|------------|--------|-----------|------|
| LesionLens Final Model     | 87.4%     | 86.7%      | 87.4%  | 86.6%     | 76.1%|
| Best External Model        | 88.8%     | Not reported| 83.8%  | Not reported| 88.8%|
| Human Expert Classification| 84.0%     | Not reported| 85.5%  | Not reported| 71.0%|

## Key Learnings & Impact
- **Image Quality:** Handling user-uploaded images required robust preprocessing techniques (resizing, noise removal, masking).
- **Class Balancing:** Augmentation methods helped improve model robustness by generating synthetic data for underrepresented classes.
- **Ensemble Approach:** A stacked logistic regression ensemble of MobileNet, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and NASNetMobile models provided the best performance.
- **Accessible Diagnostics:** LesionLens provides diagnostic support directly to users, lowering barriers to early skin cancer detection.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Image Preprocessing:** Integrate additional image preprocessing techniques for better noise handling.
- **Expanded Classification:** Extend the model to classify multiple types of skin conditions, beyond just binary (malignant/benign).
- **Continuous Model Improvement:** Implement user feedback for continuous model refinement.
